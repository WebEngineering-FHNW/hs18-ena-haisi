## Commit Proposal

Matriculation Number: 15-652-969

Project idea short description:

In appreciation of Swiss Style and Swiss Typography this project will be the place to learn about famous artists and
their works - specifically posters.  
As I am fairly experience with professional back-end development, I will focus on creating an appealing UI.

### Possible Workflow

- Display all upload posters in a gallery
- Create Artist (if not already there)
- Create needed tags
- Upload poster and assign values

### Constraints

- Ascetically pleasing display of the posters in a grid-layout
- Use CSS3 grid-layout

### Possible Extensions

- Filter by tag (e.g. only display political posters)


## Project confirmation

Perfect.
I like your approach that you extend your knowledge rather than applying what you already know.

External contributions:

- https://www.phoca.cz/cssflags/ for the svg of the Swiss flag.

Other comments: -

I'm particular proud of:  

- Using CSS grid-layout and flexbox-layout.
- Having the file-upload in the same 'form' as the rest of the poster creation. 
The official guide used a separate form.


## Project grading 

index.html given and fully valid. Good use of semantic elements.

The application works nicely except that an uploaded image is not properly displayed 
(image url responds 404).

The application features an information system for three domain classes, two in one-to-many
relationship, with the respective CRUD operations. The main 'grid' view comes with a css styling
that responds nicely and dynamicly to changing window sizes.
Images can be uploaded and are saved as blobs in the database.

Beside the usual navigation and input features, there is some elaborate input validation for the
image upload.

The commit log is stellar! 53 commits make you #3 in the all-time highscore list!

There are nice unit and integration tests. The amount of testing makes me awarding all 5 points,
even though three tests are failing for me and two test classes are empty.

The HTML is valid.
Comments are entirely missing.
The naming is ok.
You have quite a lot of duplication in controllers and views 
due to using "generate-all" rather than dynamic scaffolding.
No other dependencies.

I award an extra point for the particular effort as proven by the commit log.
I would have awarded a second one for the image handling if it would have worked for me.

Congratulations! This is a nice full-stack application with some interesting challenges.

Grade: 5.9
