# WebEngineering Module, Graded Exercise

## Commit Proposal

Matriculation Number: 15-652-969

Project idea short description:

In appreciation of Swiss Style and Swiss Typography this project will be the place to learn about famous artists and
their works - specifically posters.  
As I am fairly experience with professional back-end development, I will focus on creating an appealing UI.

### Possible Workflow

- Display all upload posters in a gallery
- Create Artist (if not already there)
- Create needed tags
- Upload poster and assign values

### Constraints

- Ascetically pleasing display of the posters in a grid-layout
- Use CSS3 grid-layout

### Possible Extensions

- Filter by tag (e.g. only display political posters)


## Project confirmation

Perfect.
I like your approach that you extend your knowledge rather than applying what you already know.

Other comments: -

I'm particular proud of:  

- Using CSS grid-layout and flexbox-layout.
- Having the file-upload in the same 'form' as the rest of the poster creation. 
The official guide used a separate form.
