# WebEngineering Module, Graded Exercise

## Commit Proposal

Matriculation Number: 15-652-969

Project idea short description:

In appreciation of Swiss Style and Swiss Typography this project will be the place to learn about famous artists and
their works - specifically posters.  
As I am fairly experience with professional back-end development, I will focus on creating an appealing UI.

### Possible Workflow

- Display all upload posters in a gallery
- Create Artist (if not already there)
- Create needed tags
- Upload poster and assign values

### Constraints

- Ascetically pleasing display of the posters in a grid-layout
- Use CSS3 grid-layout

### Possible Extensions

- Filter by tag (e.g. only display political posters)
